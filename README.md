# Asset Zip Management with PhysFS

## About me
I am Roger Salas, student of Video Games Degree by UPC at CITM. This content is generated for the second yearâ€™s subject Project 2, under supervision of Pedro Omedas.


## About the project
This project is about loading assets from a compressed archive using the librerys PhysFS, SDL and PugiXML.

Types of compressed archive:
  - ZIP   - GRP
  - 7Z    - HOG
  - ISO   - MVL
  - PAK   - WAD
  - SLB   - VDF


PhysFS to open the Zip file and achieve the main goal.

SDL to create the windows to show a texture, play a sound, and use the fils from the Zip file.

PugiXML to load the path of the files


You can find some information in the [PhysFS Web](https://icculus.org/physfs/) or in the [PhysFS GitHub](https://github.com/icculus/physfs).
